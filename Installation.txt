What is the output of the following code and explain why:

$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$b";
echo $a.", ".$b;


Answer : 21 ,21
Explainetion :  
$a = ‘1’; // output is 1.
$b = &$a; // $b will be 1, because $b content the reference of $a.
$b = “2$b”; //$b value will be 21 as 2 is concatenated to the value of $b. 
echo $a.", ".$b; // output will be 21, 21

$a and $b are completely equal here. $b is not pointing to $q or vice versa. $a and $b are pointing to the same place.
